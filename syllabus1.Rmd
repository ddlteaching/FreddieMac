**Lectures:** Mondays, 5:30PM-6:30PM, NIH Campus, Building 60, Room 162.

**Course Description**

The goal of this course is to introduce biomedical research scientists
to R as an analysis platform rather than a programming language.
Throughout the course, emphasis will be placed on example-driven
learning. Topics to be covered include: installation of R and R
packages; command line R; R data types; loading data in R; manipulating
data; exploring data through visualization; statistical tests;
correcting for multiple comparisons; building models; and. generating
publication-quality graphics. No prior programming experience is
required.

**Learning Objectives**

-   Run R GUI and make use of command line features, including command
    > history and help pages

-   Find and make use of the extensive libraries (R add-ons) available
    > for analyzing biological and other forms of data

-   Load, manipulate, and combine data to make it amenable to further
    > analyses

-   Visualize data with extensive graphics capabilities of R
    > (including ggplot)

-   Use appropriate statistical tests on data within R that will conform
    > to standards expected in scientific journals

**Required Books**

There are no required books for this class. We will recommend online
resources for the use of R in data analysis.

**Class Project**

Grading will be based on your class project, to be completed by and
presented at our final class. Each student will demonstrate the learning
objectives of the class on their own set of data. Ideally, the data used
will actually be the student’s own data, or at least data familiar to
them. Within their presentation, students will describe the data and how
it was loaded and analyzed within R/RStudio. Instructors will evaluate
the projects based on whether they demonstrate the learning objectives,
with one point for each of following demonstrated: importing data, data
manipulation, statistical analysis, use of a package, and data
visualization. The point total will then be translated to a letter
grade: 0 or 1 =F, 2=D, 3=C, 4=B, 5=A.

**POLICY ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY**

The FAES Graduate School at NIH prides itself on providing quality
educational experiences and upholds the highest level of honesty,
integrity, and mutual respect. It is our policy that cheating,
fabrication or plagiarism by students is\
not acceptable in any form. If a student is found to be in violation of
any, or all of the below, his/her credits will be forfeited, and he/she
will not be allowed to enroll in future courses or education programs
administered by FAES.

• Cheating is defined as an attempt to give or obtain inappropriate/
unauthorized assistance during any academic exercise, such as during
examination, homework assignment, class presentation.\
• Fabrication is defined as the falsification of data, information or
citations in any academic materials.\
• Plagiarism is defined as using the ideas, methods, or written words of
another, without proper acknowledgment and with the intention that they
be taken as the work of the deceiver. These include, but are not limited
to, the use of published articles, paraphrasing, copying someone else’s
homework and turning it in as one’s own and failing to reference
footnotes. Procuring information from online sources without proper
attribution also constitutes plagiarism.
