<a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a> is one of the most popular programming languages. It is a free and open source language available for 
all major operating systems. It is extensible through a packaging system that has resulted
in over 110,000 user-contributed packages available on <a href="http://pypi.python.org" target="_blank">PyPi</a>.

The <a href="https://pydata.org/downloads.html" target="_blank">Python Data Science stack</a> has become a very capable stack for data analysis and 
machine learning, which is then easily deployable. In this course, we will develop
a knowledge of some major machine learning algorithms, how they may be implemented, and how the Python Data Science stack can be used to fit these machine learning models
to datasets.
