# Interpreting a linear model

## Familiar interpretation

The slope is the change in outcome for a unit change in predictor value, everything 
else remaining the same

## Counterfactual argument

This is a counterfactual argument

What __could__ happen

## Counterfactuals from ML models

Use the prediction engine to generate counterfactual predictions

1. Binary predictor _x_
2. Train model on data when x= 0 (M0)
3. Predict on data when x = 1
4. Compare these predictions with cross-validated predictions when x = 0
5. Differences give individual level counterfactual effect
6. Average to get the "average treatment effect (ATE)"

## Counterfactuals from ML models

+ M0 captures environment when x=0
+ The prediction captures what might happen when someone with x=1 is transplanted into the x=0 environment
