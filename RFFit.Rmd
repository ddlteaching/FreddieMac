## Random Forest

Random Forests are 

+ bagged decision trees where
+ a random subset of predictors is used for each split

## Random Forests

There are four main parameters for a random forest:

1. Number of estimators (bootstrap samples)
2. Proportion of predictors to use at each split (`max_features`)
3. Depth of each tree (`max_depth`)
4. Minimum sample size at each terminal node (`min_sample_leaf`)
